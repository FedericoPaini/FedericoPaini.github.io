I'm a Program/Project Manager(yes, one of those!)Â with an extreme passion for technology, computing, and all things geek. I'm currently a Sr. Solution Architect for [Saleforce](http://www.salesforce.com/services)

I started coding in Commodore64 BASIC when I was 14 years old and I never looked back. In my spare time I'm an avid fitness and nutrition enthusiast, PHP, Ruby and iOS programmer. I live in Tampa, FL.
