---

I'm a Program/Project Manager (yes, one of those!)Â with an extreme passion for technology, computing, and all things geek. I'm currently a Program Manager Director @[Saleforce](https://www.salesforce.com/services/overview/) working on Sales/Service Cloud implementations for fortune 100 clients.

I started coding in Commodore64 BASIC when I was 14 years old and I never looked back. In my spare time I'm an avid technology and gaming enthusiast, cyclist, and `PHP/Javascript/Python/Apex` programmer. I live in Tampa Bay, FL.
