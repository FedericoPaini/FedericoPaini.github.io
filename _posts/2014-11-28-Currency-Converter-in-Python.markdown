Recently I find myself traveling quite a bit internationally. I needed a program to quickly convert my money into the currency of the country I happen to visit at the moment. I took advantage of this need to practice my coding skills in Python. In this post I explain how I did  it.

I'm always refining the code. You can find the most updated version on this program on [Github](https://github.com/FedericoPaini/Python/blob/master/currencyExchangeCalculator.py).

###Business requirements/user stories

1. As I user I need to be able to put in any amount I desire and see the resulted converted output on screen
* As a user I need a program for CLI in which converts any amount to a destination currency of my choice (i.e.: US Dollars to Euros)
  * Needs to convert a source currency to a destination currency 
  * Needs to have a menu to pick what conversion rate to use 
  * The output needs to be formatted (i.e: $3,235.50)
* The conversion rate used should not be more the 24 hours old


###How the program works

The user gets prompted to chose from a menu of possible conversions as shown in Fig. 1 below

![Fig. 1 - Main Menue](http://codecoms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/screen1-300x155.png)


After the user has chosen which currency to convert the prompt asks for the amount to convert as shown in Fig.2

When the user hits return the calculated amount converted in the desired currency is shown along with the conversion rate as shown in Fig.3
